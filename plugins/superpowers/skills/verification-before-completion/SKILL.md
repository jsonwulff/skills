# Verification Before Completion

<!-- TODO: Customize — based on obra/superpowers -->

## Rule

Never claim something works without proof. Run the command, read the output, then report.

## Checklist

- [ ] Run the relevant test suite
- [ ] Read the full output (don't assume pass)
- [ ] Run the build if applicable
- [ ] Check for regressions in related areas
- [ ] Only then claim completion
