# Executing Plans

<!-- TODO: Customize — based on obra/superpowers -->

## Overview

Execute an implementation plan task by task with review checkpoints between each task.

## Process

1. Read the plan document
2. Work through tasks in order
3. After each task: verify, commit, checkpoint
4. If blocked, stop and ask — don't guess
