# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

<!-- TODO: Customize with your own brainstorming workflow -->
<!-- Based on obra/superpowers — replace this with your forked version -->

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — don't overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** — easier to answer
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — remove unnecessary features
- **Explore alternatives** — always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** — present design in sections, validate each
