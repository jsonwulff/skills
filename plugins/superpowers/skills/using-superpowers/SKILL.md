# Using Superpowers

<!-- TODO: Customize — based on obra/superpowers -->

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant skills BEFORE any response or action.** If there's even a small chance a skill applies, invoke it first.

## How to Access Skills

Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded — follow it directly.

## Skill Priority

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) — determine HOW to approach
2. **Implementation skills second** (domain-specific) — guide execution
