# Receiving Code Review

<!-- TODO: Customize — based on obra/superpowers -->

## Overview

When receiving feedback, verify it technically before acting. Don't blindly agree or blindly implement.

## Process

1. Read the feedback carefully
2. Verify the claim — is the reviewer correct?
3. If correct: implement the fix
4. If incorrect: explain why with evidence
5. If unclear: ask for clarification
